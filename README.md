## Company  
**Laucs** is developing a safety‑first **User Generated Content** platform built for creators who want freedom with structure and reliability.

I’m currently working toward securing the ideal domain for the company.  
- Purchasing it outright costs **$7,522**  
- Leasing it costs **$625 per month**, totaling **$7,500**  

The plan is to fully acquire the domain, but losing it would significantly impact the company’s trajectory.
